## About the Project
The aim of this study to describe annual trends in bedded intermediate-level healthcare use in older people across in NHS Grampian for the five-year period  2018 and 2023, and to examine differences in use between sub-populations and service providers. 
The goal of the research is to answer the following questions:
- Who receives bed-based intermediate care in Grampian?
- What proportion of intermediate care is preventative (“step-up”)?
- What are the medical needs of the patients?
- Has these measures changed over time?
- Are there differences in these measures across care locations?

Using anonymised, population-scale, individual-level linked NHS and government data, the objectives of this study are to: 
1)	Describe the incidence of intermediate care use in people age 50+ in the NHS Grampian region 
2)	Describe patient pathways into intermediate care in people age 50+ in the NHS Grampian region over time
3)	Measure differences in intermediate care population and pathways into care between service providers
4)	Measure differences in intermediate care population and pathways into care by patient medical acuity
5)	Measure difference in intermediate care population and pathways by patient demographics
